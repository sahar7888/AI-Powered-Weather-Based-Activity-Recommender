        "# **This project demonstrates a dynamic integration of weather data retrieval and AI-driven activity recommendations using Open-Meteo's free weather API and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. Users can input the name of a city, and the application fetches the city's current weather conditions, including temperature and a brief description of the weather (e.g., clear skies or cloudy). This information is then passed to the GPT model through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, where the AI generates personalized activity suggestions suitable for the current weather. The project is implemented with a user-friendly interface using Gradio, allowing seamless interaction and showcasing the practical application of AI in daily decision-making scenarios, such as planning outdoor activities based on real-time weather insights.**"
